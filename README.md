# Machine Learning with Python
**Libraries:** 
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Linear Regression (LR)
The following regression methods were applied to analyze the dataset **Cycle Power data over 6 years (2006-2011)**, includes:
* Simple LR
* Multiple LR
* Nonlinear LR 
* Full LR with Interations 

To better analyze dataset and illustrate results, pairplots and scatterplots were plotted as shown in the notebook.


## SVM
Following types of learning based on  SVM were applied on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**:
* Supervised Learning       (see `Supervised-Learning.ipynb`)
* Unsupervised Learning     (see `Unsupervised-Learning.ipynb`)
* Semi-Supervised Learning  (see `Semi-Supervised-Learning.ipynb`)  

And then compare scores(**Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-score, AUC**) obtained from those 3 algorithms.
