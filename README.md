# Machine Learning with Python
**Libraries:** 
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Homework 2
In homework2, various regression methods were applied to analyze Cycle Power data over 6 years (2006-2011), includes:
* simple linear regression
* multiple linear regression
* nonlinear regression 
* full linear regression with interations 

To better analyze dataset and illustrate results, pairplots and scatterplots were plotted as shown in the notebook.

## Homework 6
In homework6, I do the following types of learning based on SVM on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set:
* Supervised Learning       (see 552_hw6_1.ipynb)
* Unsupervised Learning     (see 552_hw6_2.ipynb)
* Semi-Supervised Learning  (see 552_hw6_3.ipynb)  

And then compare scores(accuracy, precision, recall, F-score and AUC) obtained from those 3 algorithms. When need to control
the cost of building a model, it is wise to choose Semi-Supevised Learning.
